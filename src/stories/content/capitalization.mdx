# Capitalization

Consistent capitalization creates a more professional and unified experience across our platform. We primarily use sentence case throughout the Prerender interface to maintain readability and a conversational tone.

<TLDR>
  <p>Use sentence case for most UI elements, with these exceptions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Proper nouns (names, places, days)</li>
    <li>Prerender product names and features</li>
    <li>Technical terms that are conventionally capitalized</li>
  </ul>
</TLDR>

## When in doubt, use sentence case

For most UI elements, capitalize only the first word and any proper nouns. This applies to navigation items, buttons, form labels, headings, and other interface text.

<DoDont
  rows={[
    {
      do: 'Clear manual queue',
      dont: 'Clear Manual Queue',
    },
    {
      do: 'Update your password',
      dont: 'Update Your Password',
    },
    {
      do: 'How can we help you?',
      dont: 'How Can We Help You?',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Exceptions

While sentence case is our default, certain elements should maintain their conventional capitalization:

- **Proper nouns**: Names of people, places, days of the week, and months
- **Product features**: Prerender-specific features like CDN Analytics, 404 Checker
- **Technical terms**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API, URL, CDN
- **Legal content**: Terms of Service, Privacy Policy
