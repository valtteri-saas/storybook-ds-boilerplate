# Icons

Icons help clarify actions, indicate status, and enhance visual hierarchy. We use Ant Design (AntD) icons throughout the UI.

## Usage

When using icons in the interface, follow these principles for clarity, accessibility, and consistency:

- Use icons to reinforce meaning, not replace it.
- Icons should clarify intent; when in doubt, include a text label.
- Aim for simplicity and familiarity. Choose icons that are easily recognizable.
- Avoid unnecessary use of icons purely for decoration.

## Icon library

We use the Ant Design Icons library, which offers a wide variety of system and utility icons. Check the full icon catalog here: [Ant Design Icons](https://ant.design/components/icon/)
