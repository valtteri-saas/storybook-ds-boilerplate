# Tokens explained

Design tokens are the foundation of visual consistency in your user interfaces. In [System Name], tokens serve as a shared language between designers and developers, simplifying decisions and reducing duplication as you scale your product experiences.

## What are design tokens?

![Token Diagram](/images/token-example.png)

Design tokens are small, reusable variables that store design values.

Rather than hardcoding values like #2da01d or 16px directly into your code or designs, tokens abstract the underlying value into a meaningful name like `color-foreground-icon`. This makes your UI more maintainable and adaptable, even as styles change over time.

Tokens help us:

- Create experiences that are visually consistent
- Support themes like dark mode
- Enable automation between design and code
- Safeguard against duplicated or arbitrary styling decisions

## Available tokens

### Color tokens

Tokens for all interface color usage; text, icons, backgrounds, surfaces, borders, and states (like danger or success).

### Data tokens

Tokens designed to support data visualizing. These tokens ensure consistent, accessible color usage across analytical views.

### Border tokens

Tokens that define consistent radii, and widths. Borders help structure layouts, distinguish components, and support accessibility.

### Space tokens

Predefined spacing values that ensure consistent vertical and horizontal rhythm across layouts. These tokens replace arbitrary padding or margin choices.

### Typography tokens

Tokens for all typographic decisions; font family, size, weight, line height, and letter spacing. Typography tokens help maintain a unified voice across platforms.

## Best practices

Use design tokens with intention and clarity. The goal is to make design and development faster, more consistent, and adaptable to change.
